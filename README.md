# Data-analysis-of-netflix
Netflix is known for its work in data science, AI, and ML, particularly for building strong recommendation models and algorithms that understand customer behavior and patterns. Suppose you are working in a data-driven job role, and you have a dataset of more than 9,000 movies. 

## Introduction of Netflix:
Netflix, founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, began as a DVD-by-mail service. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, co-founded the company after being inspired by a hefty late fee from a traditional video rental store. Randolph, a marketing executive, played a pivotal role in shaping Netflix's early user interface and branding.
In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming services, allowing subscribers to watch movies and TV shows instantly online. This strategic shift capitalized on the growing internet bandwidth and changing consumer preferences, propelling Netflix into a leading global streaming platform. By 2010, the company began its international expansion, starting with Canada, and by 2016, it was available in over 190 countries
